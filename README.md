Exploring Data with Pandas
During this project, I engaged in a comprehensive exploration of data using the Pandas library.

Managing Missing Data and Irrelevant Entries
I addressed missing data and irrelevant entries, enhancing the dataset's quality and integrity, ensuring accurate insights and conclusions.

Sorting for Clarity
I used sorting techniques to arrange data logically, making a better understanding of trends and patterns present in the dataset.

Identifying Lowest Risk
By identifying lowest risk entries, I honed my ability to extract meaningful information from data, aiding decision-making processes.

Grouping and Pivoting Data
I gained expertise in grouping and pivoting data,performing analyses and deriving insights from different perspectives.

Formatting Output with Precision
I presented numerical outputs in various formats, clarifying analysis results.

Through the completion of the Pandas_Major project, I refined my skills in data manipulation, analysis, and presentation.
